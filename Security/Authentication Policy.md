Here are six essential ways developers can go beyond the security of simple password-based authentication. 

1. Add controls for minimum password length and complexity 

Developers must implement controls for enforcing a minimum length and complexity requirements for all passwords that are used to authenticate user access to enterprise systems. 

 

2. Require multifactor authentication 

Requiring users to submit one additional credential for verifying their identity beyond just a password is a relatively painless yet surprisingly effective mechanism for bolstering the effectiveness of password-based authentication. 

 

3. Consider controls for adaptive authentication techniques 

In addition, the organization could implement adaptive authentication in a way that, in addition to the credential, requires something the user has, or better, something the user is 

 

4. Enable single sign-on 

One of the most effective ways to address poor password security practices is to implement a single sign-on (SSO) capability with multifactor authentication support, said Sander.
