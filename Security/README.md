**Security CIA compliance for the project**

While designing and developing this product. 

Irrespective of what is being built, in incorporating security, the CIA triad has to be considered. 

*What is the CIA triad?* 

The CIA triad is a widely used information security model that can guide an organization's efforts and policies aimed at keeping its data secure. 

CIA - These three letters stand for confidentiality, integrity, and availability. These three individual concepts when put together form the cornerstone of any organization's security infrastructure. 

CIA triad is essential as it provides vital security features, helps in avoiding compliance issues, ensures business continuity, and prevents reputational damage to the organization 

**Confidentiality:** Only authorized users and processes should be able to access or modify data 

**Integrity:** Data should be maintained in a correct state and nobody should be able to improperly modify it, either accidentally or maliciously 

**Availability:** Authorized users should be able to access data whenever they need to do so 

*The Project which is a Mortality Prediction Software should be built with the CIA triad evident in every step*

**Confidentiality:** Ensure that it is designed in such a way that only the authorized users 
i.e the particular health practitioners can have access to it. 
It must not be available to unwanted users e.g other health practitioners or user. 
It must be as private as it should be 

**Integrity:** Data should be maintained in a correct state and nobody should be able to improperly modify it, either accidentally or maliciously. This implies that the information and details of the patients should be in good condition at all the time and should not be edited when not intended to be by authorized users. 

**Availability:** The authorized users; in this case, the health practitioner should be able to access information of the patients anytime it is needed.  

 

The design team ensured that the designs provided allow the developers incorporate properly the CIA triad.
